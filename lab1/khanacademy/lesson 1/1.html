    <h1>
        From The Rape Of Lucrece by William Shakespeare </h1>
        <p> Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,<br>
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;<br>
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
Between whose hills her head entombed is;
Where like a virtuous monument she lies,
To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.

Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet, whose perfect white
Showed like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
Till they might open to adorn the day. </p>
